        <p id="p1">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to style and layout web pages â€” for example, to
            alter the font,
            color, size and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
            decorative
            features.</p>
        <p id="p2">
            CSS is one of the cornerstone technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. Whereas
            HTML
            provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices.
        </p>
        <p id="p3">
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
            This
            separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
            presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS
            in a
            separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
