        <th class="bca">The Rhodes Piano is an iconic electric piano known for its distinctive sound and
            smooth playability. It was invented by Harold Rhodes in the 1940s and gained popularity in the 1960s and
            1970s,
            particularly in jazz, rock, and pop music. The instrument features a unique design where hammers strike thin
            metal
            tines, which are then amplified to produce sound. The Rhodes Piano is celebrated for its warm, bell-like
            tones and
            has been used by numerous legendary musicians, making it a staple in the world of music.
